Hey ðŸ‘‹  I'm a Software Engineer and currently, I'm working with Clojure/Script at [Pitch](https://pitch.com/).


Besides coding applications in general I've been studying Data Science &amp; Machine Learning since last year and I decided to create a blog to exercise my communication skills, organize my learning and get some feedback. You can find it here: [https://pitch.com/u/nathan](https://pitch.com/u/nathan)


I'd love to chat about tech, mentoring, NVC, books, etc. Feel free to reach out!
