Hey 👋 Nice to meet you. 

I'm Nathan. I'm a Software Engineer, focused mainly on frontend apps with Javascript and Clojure/Script.

Besides coding applications in general I've been studying Data Science &amp; Machine Learning for two years now and I decided to document it to exercise my communication skills, organize my learning and get some feedback. 

📄 I'm documenting my learning process in [this repo](https://github.com/nathanqueija/datajourney)

🖼️ You can also find some of my presentations [here](https://pitch.com/u/nathan).


I'd love to chat about tech, mentoring, NVC, books, etc. Feel free to reach out!
