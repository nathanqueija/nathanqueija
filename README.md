Hey ðŸ‘‹  Nathan here. I'm a Software Engineer and currently, I'm working with Clojure/Script at Pitch.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides coding applications in general I've been studying Data Science &amp; Machine Learning since last year and I decided to create a blog to exercise my communication skills, organize my learning and get some feedback.</p> You can find it here: nathanqueija.me

<p>I'd love to chat about tech, mentoring, NVC, books, etc. Feel free to reach out!</p>
